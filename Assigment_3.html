        <h3>Dish 9: <big>Chargha</big></h3>
        <img src="dish9.jpg" alt="Dish 9">
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>With chicken being cheap and readily available, much is made of the humble capon. Marinated in a combination of spices and yogurt infuses the entire bird with delicate flavors.The best way to go is to use freshly slaughtered chicken. It is more succulent and quickly absorbs the spices blended with yogurt. Next, the chicken is left in the refrigerator overnight. For the healthier version, the chicken is roasted, known as tandoori Chargah. But the old-fashioned way is to deep-fry it.</p>

        <h3>Dish 10: <big>Kashmiri Biryani</big></h3>
        <img src="dish10.jpg" alt="Dish 10">
        <h5>Description:</h5>
        <p>You could reasonably say this is similar to pulao, but in fact, it isn’t. Both are rice dishes with generously seasoned spices. However, biryani is served as a main dish, unlike pulao, which is a side dish for gravy-based dishes such as dar.
            Ingredients such as mint leaves, raisins, and rose water give the long-grained rice authenticity. And if you like, ghee can be replaced with regular oil. Mutton, herbs, toppings such as carrots and saffron, together with nuts are mixed together when it is served. Other Pakistani Biryanis that might blow your breath away include the Sindhi biryani, originating from the Sindh province, and the infamous bone marrow biryani from Karachi.</p>
